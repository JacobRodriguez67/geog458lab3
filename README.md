# Functionality
## Data Visualization: 
The map represents COVID-19 case data using circles placed over different regions of the United States. The size and color of each circle correspond to the severity and intensity of COVID-19 outbreaks in those regions. Larger circles and darker colors typically indicate higher numbers of cases.
## Interactive Features: 
Users can interact with the map by clicking on individual circles to access detailed information about COVID-19 cases in specific regions. This information may include the total number of cases, the number of cases per 1000 people, and other relevant metrics.
## Legend: 
The legend panel provides a visual key to interpret the meaning of the circle sizes and colors. It helps users understand the relationship between the visual representation on the map and the actual COVID-19 case data.
## Data Source: 
The COVID-19 case data displayed on the map is sourced from a GeoJSON file containing information about case counts in various counties or regions across the United States. This data is typically obtained from reliable health organizations or government agencies tracking and reporting COVID-19 statistics.

## Purpose
The primary objective of this map is to provide users with a clear and visual understanding of the geographical distribution and severity of COVID-19 outbreaks in the United States. By presenting COVID-19 case data in a spatial context, the maps enable users to identify areas with high infection rates, track trends over time, and make informed decisions regarding public health measures and interventions. Additionally, the interactive features of the maps enhance user engagement and facilitate the exploration of COVID-19 data at a granular level, aiding in analysis and decision-making processes.
